🧑‍💻 Code Explanation

Schema Validation (Zod)

We use Zod to ensure that user inputs are valid before submission:

const schema = z.object({
  fullName: z.string().min(3, "Full Name must be at least 3 characters"),
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email address"),
  phoneNumber: z.string().regex(/\d{10}/, "Phone Number must be exactly 10 digits"),
  dateOfBirth: z.string().nonempty("Date of Birth is required").refine((dob) => {
    const birthDate = new Date(dob);
    const today = new Date();
    const age = today.getFullYear() - birthDate.getFullYear();
    return age >= 18;
  }, "Must be 18 years or older"),
  initialDeposit: z.preprocess((val) => Number(val), z.number().min(100, "Minimum deposit is $100")),
  zipCode: z.string().regex(/\d{5}/, "Zip Code must be exactly 5 digits"),
  terms: z.boolean().refine((value) => value === true, "You must accept the Terms & Conditions"),
});


Form Handling (React Hook Form)

The form is managed using React Hook Form for efficiency and simplicity:

const { control, register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(schema),
  defaultValues: { accountType: "", currency: "" }
});

Form Submission

On submission, the data is logged and a success message is shown:

const onSubmit = (data) => {
  console.log("Form Data:", data);
  alert("Account successfully opened!");
};

UI Components (Material-UI)

The form uses Material-UI components for better styling and UX:

<TextField
  fullWidth
  label="Full Name"
  {...register("fullName")}
  error={!!errors.fullName}
  helperText={errors.fullName?.message}
/>
